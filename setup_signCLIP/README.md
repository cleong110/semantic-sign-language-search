Scripts, files, etc to setup SignCLIP locally. 

[setup_signclip.sh](setup_signclip.sh) attempts to clone SignCLIP and install requirements and put files in the right places. 
[demo_sign_embed_and_save.py](demo_sign_embed_and_save.py) will embed every .pose file in a folder with every model you give it. It assumes the .yaml files are in the expected places, the models are in the right folders, and the requirements are installed in the current environment.
