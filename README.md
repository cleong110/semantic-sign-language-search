# semantic-sign-language-search
Search a folder of sign language videos semantically.

OK so recapping:

    videos_to_poses on my data
    pose_to_segments on each .pose
    https://github.com/sign-language-processing/recognition/blob/main/sign_language_recognition/bin.py to cut, similar to https://github.com/sign-language-processing/lexicon-induction
    embed with signCLIP, save off the embeddings
    FAISS maybe?

How to search?
* FAISS maybe?

Amit says: 
> iâ€™d probably store the embeddings in a database like https://redis.io/solutions/vector-search/ or https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector
then search using the built in database search, similarity, etc. fast stuff
